// This is where you should write all JavaScript
// for your project. Remember a few things as you start!
// - Use let or const for all variables
// - Do not use jQuery - use JavaScript instead
// - Do not use onclick - use addEventListener instead
// - Run npm run test regularly to check autograding
// - You'll need to link this file to your HTML :)
